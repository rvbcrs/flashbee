# Flash Bee

Handheld lightning sensing and ranging device built around the AMS **AS3935**
lightning sensor: it shows strike distance, per-strike energy, a short history
of recent strikes, and a big red `SHELTER` warning when a strike lands within
~10 km.

## Hardware

| Part                                        | Role                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3 or ESP32-C6             | MCU (two PIO envs — C6 via pioarduino) |
| Seeed Round Display v1.1 (GC9A01, 240×240)  | UI (SPI) + capacitive touch + battery  |
| Seeed Grove AS3935                          | Lightning detection (I²C, addr `0x03`) |

Pin assignments use the XIAO silkscreen labels (D0…D10), which map to
different underlying GPIOs on C3 vs C6 but sit in the same physical
positions on the board. `SDA = D4`, `SCL = D5`; SPI for the display is
configured via Setup501 in Seeed_GFX.

### Extra wire: AS3935 `INT` → XIAO `D2`

The Instructables assembly already asks you to cut the Grove connector
off the module and solder direct bridges for 3V3, GND, SDA and SCL.
**Add one more wire:** from the AS3935 module's `INT` pad to XIAO
**D2 (GPIO4)**. This lets the firmware measure the antenna's LC-tank
resonance and pick the correct `TUN_CAP` value automatically — without
it, every distance reading is biased. Override the pin with
`-DAS3935_INT_PIN=<n>` if D2 isn't convenient for your wiring.

### Round Display v1.1 KE switch

Per the [Seeed wiki](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/seeedstudio_round_display_usage/),
Round Display v1.1 added a 2-bit DIP switch ("KE") in the middle
of the microSD-slot area. Its two positions mean:

- **KE ON** — A0 connects to the onboard battery-voltage divider
  (R28/R29 → VBAT/2), and D6 connects to the backlight MOSFET
  gate. This is the configuration the firmware is built around:
  the settings screen shows `BAT x.xx V  NN%`, and the inactivity
  timeout cuts the backlight fully.
- **KE OFF** — A0 and D6 are electrically disconnected from the
  display module's circuits and become plain XIAO GPIOs for the
  user to wire as they like. With the switch in this position the
  backlight stays on permanently regardless of firmware state
  (still gets `DISPOFF + SLPIN` so the pixels go black), and the
  battery reading shows `BAT --`.

Firmware never drives A0 (it's an analog input when KE is on, and
the user's free GPIO when KE is off — either way, actively driving
it would be wrong). D6 is driven for backlight. Override with
`-DTFT_BL_PIN=<n>` if you wire it differently.

## Build

Requires [PlatformIO Core](https://platformio.org/install/cli).

```bash
pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32c3            # compile
pio run -e seeed_xiao_esp32c3 -t upload  # flash via USB-C
pio device monitor -b 115200             # serial log
```

The first build fetches `Seeed_GFX` and `Seeed_Arduino_RoundDisplay` from
GitHub into `.pio/libdeps/`.

### Why `-DBOARD_SCREEN_COMBO=501`?

Seeed_GFX's `Dynamic_Setup.h` selects the pinout/driver via the
`BOARD_SCREEN_COMBO` macro. The canonical Arduino-IDE workflow drops a
`driver.h` into the sketch folder, which Seeed_GFX picks up with
`__has_include("driver.h")`. Under PlatformIO the project's `include/`
directory is **not** on the include path when library source files
(inside `Seeed_GFX/`) are compiled, so that `__has_include` silently
returns false and the library falls through to combo `666` — a CI stub
with the wrong pinout for the round display. The build still succeeds
but the display stays dark on hardware. Defining the macro via
`build_flags` makes it visible to every compilation unit uniformly.

## Layout

```
platformio.ini          # board, libs, build_flags
src/main.ino            # single-file firmware
```

## What it shows

Main screen:

- **Big yellow number** — estimated distance in km, or `OVERHEAD` / `>40` /
  `-- distance unknown`.
- **Arc gauge** — last-strike energy (0–21 bit AS3935 word) mapped 0–100 %.
- **Inward-pulsing concentric rings** — "listening" indicator. Purely
  radial (the AS3935 is non-directional — any rotating element would
  falsely imply bearing capability). Green-teal normally, red-amber
  during the shelter window.
- **Strikes / Energy** — running count and last-strike energy.
- **Energy history** — 20-slot ring-buffer bar chart. Labelled `(stale)`
  once the last strike is more than 5 min old.
- **Status line under the title** — `OUT/IN WD:n SR:n` (current AFE mode
  + filter levels). Turns amber when filters have tightened beyond
  mid-range, red `ENV TOO NOISY` when the noise floor has hit the
  hardware ceiling and the chip is no longer operating within spec.
- **`!! SHELTER !!` overlay** — blinks red/amber when a strike is
  detected within ~10 km (close threshold per NWS 30/30 rule). The
  right-side footer swaps to `SHELTER m:ss` counting up from the
  last close strike. Clears automatically 30 minutes after the
  last close strike.
- **`SENSOR LOST` overlay** — shown when I²C has failed 8+ times in a
  row; the firmware keeps retrying `initAS3935()` every 3 s until
  the sensor comes back.

Settings screen (swipe horizontally):

- **INDOOR / OUTDOOR** — AFE gain toggle, persisted to NVS.
- **SCREEN** — backlight inactivity timeout (30 s … NEVER).
- **SLEEP** — light-sleep inactivity timeout (5 min … NEVER). Wakes
  on strike, disturber (silent), or any touch.
- **RESET FILTERS** — restores NF/WD/SR to defaults, clears AS3935
  lightning statistics via the `CL_STAT` toggle. Does *not* clear
  the shelter timer (safety: no UI-level "pretend it's safe" button).
- **Footer** — `BAT x.xx V  NN%` live battery readout (Round Display
  v1.1 KE switch ON) and `NF  WD  SR` current AS3935 filter state.

## Power management

Three tiers, all individually configurable from the settings screen
and persisted across power cycles:

1. **Interrupt-driven AS3935.** `D2` receives a hardware IRQ from the
   module (see wiring section above). The firmware never polls — it
   reacts in microseconds and the I²C bus is quiet between events.
2. **Backlight off (Tier 2).** After `SCREEN` minutes of no touches
   and no strikes, `D6` goes low and the GC9A01 enters `DISPOFF` +
   `SLPIN`. Disturbers / noise-floor events don't reset this timer
   — they still get processed silently, they just don't wake the
   display.
3. **CPU light sleep (Tier 3).** After `SLEEP` minutes more, the
   ESP32 enters `esp_light_sleep_start()`. Wake sources: AS3935 INT
   rising (strike/disturber) or touch going low. A strike wakes the
   display; a plain disturber processes silently and goes back to
   sleep. USB-CDC drops during sleep and re-enumerates on wake.

Estimated current draw on the Trustfire 10440 (300 mAh):

| State              | ~Current | Runtime on 280 mAh usable |
|--------------------|----------|---------------------------|
| Main UI active     | 50 mA    | 5.5 h                     |
| Screen off         | 28 mA    | 10 h                      |
| Light sleep        | 3–5 mA   | 55–90 h                   |

## First-time setup — antenna calibration

After the first flash, open the serial monitor before plugging in (or
hit the reset button after plugging in) and watch for:

```
[tune] no saved antenna calibration.
[tune] send 'tune' on serial to calibrate now.
```

Type `tune` and hit enter within the 5-second window. The firmware:

1. Issues `PRESET_DEFAULT` + `CALIB_RCO` to the AS3935.
2. Sets `DISP_LCO` bit and `LCO_FDIV = ÷128` — routes the LC-tank
   oscillator to the AS3935 `INT` pin, divided down to ~3906 Hz.
3. Sweeps `TUN_CAP` from 0 to 15, counting rising edges on the
   XIAO GPIO for 200 ms per step.
4. Picks the value closest to 3906 Hz, saves it to NVS (via
   `Preferences`), and continues into normal detector mode with
   that `TUN_CAP` applied.

Serial output looks like:

```
TUN_CAP= 0 -> 3863 Hz (-43)
TUN_CAP= 1 -> 3885 Hz (-21)
TUN_CAP= 2 -> 3903 Hz  (-3)
TUN_CAP= 3 -> 3921 Hz (+15)
...
best: TUN_CAP=2 @ 3903 Hz (dev -3, WITHIN TOL)
```

The screen shows a live progress bar during the sweep and a summary
panel at the end (`TUNED` green, or `OUT OF RANGE` red if nothing on
the sweep lands within ±3.5 %).

**To re-calibrate later:** on any subsequent boot there's a 1.5-second
window right after the AS3935 init screen where `tune` will retrigger
the sweep. Hit reset, type `tune` on serial, done.

**If the sweep fails with `NO SIGNAL` / `check INT wire`:** the
firmware saw zero edges on `AS3935_INT_PIN`. Either the jumper from
the AS3935 module's `INT` pad isn't connected, or it's on a different
GPIO than D2. Without that wire the tune cannot run and the firmware
falls back to the compile-time default (`AS3935_TUN_CAP`, 0 unless
overridden) — the detector still works, but distance estimates will
be whatever the out-of-the-box LC tank produces.

## Safety-critical fixes vs. the Instructables original

The original sketch was reviewed twice (once by Claude, once by Codex)
against the AS3935 datasheet (rev 1.07 §8.10–§8.11). The import commit
is kept intact at `7707720` so the deltas are traceable. Fix commit
`107898d` addresses the following:

### Accuracy of the distance readout

- **AFE gain byte was encoded wrong.** `AFE_GB` lives in `REG0x00[5:1]`,
  so the 5-bit field value has to be shifted one bit up before being
  written to the register. The original wrote `0b00010010` (0x12) when
  aiming for the indoor encoding `0b10010` — which placed `0b01001` = 9
  into the field, outside the datasheet's valid `{14 outdoor, 18
  indoor}` pair. Fix: use `(0b01110 << 1) = 0x1C` for outdoor (new
  default — this is a handheld) or `(0b10010 << 1) = 0x24` for indoor.
  Override at build time with `-DAS3935_AFE_GB=AFE_GB_INDOOR`.
- **`PRESET_DEFAULT` + `CALIB_RCO` never ran.** The original skipped
  both direct commands, so the internal RCO timebase used to measure
  strike-pulse energy was uncalibrated and distance estimates were
  therefore unspecified. `initAS3935()` now issues both on every init
  and verifies `TRCO_CALIB_DONE` / `SRCO_CALIB_DONE` (bit 7) plus the
  corresponding `_NOK` bit (bit 6) in regs 0x3A/0x3B before proceeding.
- **Antenna `TUN_CAP` was never set.** Reg 0x08 [3:0] controls the LC
  tank trim; the factory-tuned value is board-specific. The firmware
  now runs a built-in sweep (see
  [First-time setup — antenna calibration](#first-time-setup--antenna-calibration))
  and stores the result in NVS.
- **Distance value `0x00` was coerced to `OVERHEAD`.** The datasheet
  only defines `0x01` (overhead) and `0x3F` (out of range); `0x00`
  is not a valid distance output. The original displayed the
  scariest-possible reading for an undefined input. Now it shows
  `-- distance unknown`.

### Robustness during a storm

- **Noise-floor ratchet only went up.** `INT_NH` caused `NF` to
  increment (stricter) but nothing ever decremented it, so a minute
  of nearby EMI could permanently deafen the detector for the rest
  of the session. `lowerNoiseFloor()` now decays `NF` by one step
  every 60 s of quiet.
- **High-noise fault was hidden.** Datasheet: `INT_NH` means the
  device cannot operate properly under the current input noise.
  The original treated it as "turn up the filter and keep going".
  When `NF` reaches the hardware maximum and `INT_NH` still fires,
  the UI now shows `ENV TOO NOISY` in red so the user knows the
  readings are no longer trustworthy.
- **No I²C error detection.** All reads blindly returned `0xFF` on
  failure, and `0xFF & 0x0F == 0x0F` didn't match any of the three
  interrupt branches — so a wedged bus caused silent permanent
  deafness. I²C calls now propagate a `bool` result; after 8
  consecutive failures the sensor is marked lost and the `SENSOR
  LOST` overlay appears. `Wire.setTimeOut(50)` prevents bus hangs
  from stalling the MCU during ESD events.
- **No stall watchdog.** If the AS3935 wedged (ESD, brownout),
  nothing noticed. A re-init fires automatically after 10 min of
  zero interrupts of any kind.

### Code clarity

- `increaseSensitivity()` / `decreaseSensitivity()` were named
  *opposite* to what they actually did relative to the datasheet
  (higher `WDTH`/`SREJ` = **less** sensitive per §8.4). Renamed to
  `tightenFilters()` / `loosenFilters()`.
- Every AS3935 register, field, and bit now has a named symbol;
  no magic `0x01`/`0x02`/`0x03` scattered through the logic.
- Reg `0x02` writes now preserve `CL_STAT_EN` / `CL_STAT` in
  bits [7:6]; the original blind full-byte write clobbered them.

### Hardware validation status

All of the above datasheet-correctness fixes have been bench-tested
on a real XIAO ESP32-C6 + Seeed Round Display v1.1 + Grove AS3935
module. What works on real silicon:

- AS3935 responds to I²C at `0x03`, `PRESET_DEFAULT` + `CALIB_RCO`
  complete successfully, TRCO/SRCO done-bits verify clean.
- Antenna auto-tune sweep runs end-to-end and picks a valid
  `TUN_CAP` within the ±3.5 % tolerance window. One tested module
  landed at `TUN_CAP=9 @ 3900 Hz` (0.15 % off target) — the
  datasheet factory default of `TUN_CAP=0` would have been 2.8 %
  off, which is why the sweep matters.
- Interrupt-driven event handling catches `INT_L`, `INT_D`, and
  `INT_NH` with no missed events under normal load.
- I²C fault-streak detection trips `SENSOR LOST` after 8
  consecutive failures; re-init retry at 3 s cadence recovers.
- Touch + swipe gesture classification, NVS persistence of AFE
  mode / tune cap / timeouts, backlight off at inactivity, and
  light-sleep wake on touch or AS3935 INT have all been exercised.

What is still open:

1. **No real CG strike observed yet.** All live data so far is
   indoor EMI (pellet heater ignition, PV inverter, LED drivers,
   etc.), which the AS3935 classifies as a mix of disturbers and
   "close strikes" with `d = 0x01` (overhead). This is expected
   indoor behaviour per the datasheet — the sensor is designed
   for outdoor open-air operation. The device needs a real
   thunderstorm before the distance readout can be cross-checked
   against [Blitzortung](https://www.blitzortung.org/).
2. The reviewer critique stands that a single-antenna detector
   produces **statistical** distance to the *head of the storm*,
   not range to the individual strike that triggered the IRQ.
   Do not treat the displayed number as a ranging result you
   would stake a decision on. The `!! SHELTER !!` overlay is the
   trustworthy output; the km number underneath is a best-effort
   estimate.
3. Battery runtime estimates in the Power management section are
   calculated, not yet measured against the real 10440 cell.
